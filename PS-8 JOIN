-- Step 3: Solve the queries using joins and subqueries

-- 1. Query to find the names (first_name, last_name) and the salaries of the employees 
-- who have a higher salary than the employee whose last_name = 'Singh'.
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary > (
    -- Subquery to find the salary of the employee with last_name 'Singh'
    SELECT salary
    FROM Employee
    WHERE last_name = 'Singh'
);

-- 2. Query to find the names (first_name, last_name) of the employees who have a manager and 
-- work for a department based in the United States.
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM Employee e
JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
JOIN Locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id
WHERE e.manager_id IS NOT NULL  -- Employees with managers
AND l.country_id = 'US';        -- Employees who work in the US

-- 3. Query to find the names (first_name, last_name), the salary of the employees whose salary is 
-- greater than the average salary of all employees.
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.salary > (
    -- Subquery to find the average salary of all employees
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM Employee
);

-- 4. Query to find the employee id, name (last_name) along with their manager_id, manager name (last_name).
SELECT e.Employee_id, e.last_name AS Employee_last_name, e.manager_id, m.last_name AS Manager_last_name
FROM Employee e
-- Join the Employee table again to get the manager details from the same Employee table
LEFT JOIN Employee m ON e.manager_id = m.Employee_id;

-- 5. Query to find the names and hire date of the employees who were hired after the employee whose last_name = 'Jones'.
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.hire_date
FROM Employee e
WHERE e.hire_date > (
    -- Subquery to find the hire date of the employee with last_name 'Jones'
    SELECT hire_date
    FROM Employee
    WHERE last_name = 'Jones'
);
